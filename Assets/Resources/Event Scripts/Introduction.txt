Huh?... Where... am I? How did I get here?
Either way, better get moving. I remember the last time I decided to sit around contemplating life.

#SPKR#Rizma:
Yes... let's add to the already odd situation with a metal detector that stands up by itself.
(sigh) What are the odds?...
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
At this rate, I would say pretty favorable actually. Now if you don't mind, I am trying to rest.
#SPKR#Rizma:
But... you're a metal detector...
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
And you keep talking to yourself. I didn't realize we were pointing out the obvious flaws in our sanity.
#SPKR#Rizma:
This can't be real!
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
Yet you are still keeping me awake with your chatter. Kindly GO AWAY NOW!
#SPKR#Rizma:
Wait, you mentioned the odds being favorable. What did you mean by that?
Besides your astonishingly great personality, I felt an ounce of truth in your words.
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
So not only do I no longer get to rest but you want me to actually talk to you?
You realize I AM a metal detector right?
#SPKR#Rizma:
Yes.
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
And you're not questioning your already seemingly shaky sanity?
#SPKR#Rizma:
Well...
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
Great, you're just the person I need! Pleased to meet you, my name is ...
