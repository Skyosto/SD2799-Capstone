Huh?... Where... am I? How did I get here?
Either way, better get moving. I remember the last time I decided to sit around contemplating life.

#SPKR#Rizma:
Yes... let's add to the already odd situation with a metal detector that stands up by itself.
(sigh) What are the odds?...
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
At this rate, I would say pretty favorable actually. Now if you don't mind, I am trying to rest.
#SPKR#Rizma:
But... you're a metal detector...
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
And you keep talking to yourself. I didn't realize we were pointing out the obvious flaws in our sanity.
#SPKR#Rizma:
This can't be real!
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
Yet you are still keeping me awake with your chatter. Kindly GO AWAY NOW!
#SPKR#Rizma:
Wait, you mentioned the odds being favorable. What did you mean by that?
Besides your astonishingly great personality, I felt an ounce of truth in your words.
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
So not only do I no longer get to rest but you want me to actually talk to you?
You realize I AM a metal detector right?
#SPKR#Rizma:
Yes.
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
And you're not questioning your already seemingly shaky sanity?
#SPKR#Rizma:
Well...
#SPKR#Metal Detector:
Great, you're just the person I need! Pleased to meet you, my name is ...

#SPKR#Metal Detector:
I knew it! It was here the entire time!

#SPKR#Shovel:
Well don't just stare at me. Help a shovel out and get to digging.
#SPKR#Rizma:
With what? My hands?
#SPKR#Shovel:
You do have two of them...
#SPKR#Rizma:
No.
#SPKR#Shovel:
Okay Mr.Sassypants. There should be another shovel around here somewhere. Go look over by that shed.
#SPKR#Rizma:
We are in the middle of a deserted beach.
I highly doubt there is anything out here, much less an entire sh...

#SPKR#Rizma:
Of course...

#SPKR#Rizma:
You know, for a magic shovel that appears in the middle of nowhere, 
you'd think it would appear a bit less... oh I don't know... old and rusty.
#SPKR#Shovel:
...
#SPKR#Shovel:
Finally! I guess my memory hasn't entirely dissipated just yet. The three eggs.

(staring in awe or maybe it's shock?) ...
#SPKR#Unknown:
At last...onward my journey continues. 
For my heart longs to find that which resides in her mind's venues.
#SPKR#Unknown:
Thank you kind soul but I must be swift in my actions. 
For if I stay here too long, my body will soon be mere rations.
#SPKR#Rizma:
Wait... who are you?
#SPKR#Unknown:
I am a soulless wanderer burdened with finding a clue, 
but for now you must leave me, forget not Rizma, my only friend is you.
